# 2048 Game

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game. You need to
move blocks in order to combine the same tiles. The goal is to
reach 2048 or a maximum you can.

This is just another implementation of [2048 Game](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) initially written by Gabriele Cirulli.
Fun project to get my hands to work with some technologies.
